<BR>WHy bother with LOGO?
<BR>TL;DR: iut is a way to ease people into programming.
<BR>lets see, it does nto have complications
<BR>of a DOM like JS does, it has instant graphical
<BR>feedback with-ought the need to use a library
<BR>like python does not have, and it also has simpler
<BR>syntax than python, syntax can scare beginners
<BR>off
<BR>also I will just be using it as a jump off point to then head onto 
<BR> python in a few lessons
